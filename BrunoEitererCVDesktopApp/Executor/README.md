# BrunoEitererCV
This application is a support application for my CV/portfolio. 

## Tech Stack
C# with .NET8

## Running the build locally
Since this is only a support application for the main CV application, it doesn't make sense to run it in isolation. It should be published and run together with the `BrunoEitererCV` project.

## Publishing
- Open the solution in Visual Studio and use the provided publishing profile in Build -> Publish. This should be published together with the `BrunoEitererCV` project.
