## Running the build locally

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (the project can also be run from the command line, but since I'm focusing on developing and publishing from Visual Studio, this is the recommendation)

### Steps
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/brunoeiterer/CV.git
```
- Open the solution in Visual Studio
- Either run the unpackaged build for `BrunoEitererCV`, or use the publish profile in both projects to generate the final output
